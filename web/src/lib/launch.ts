/**
 * Start run — a resumable orchestration over the existing typed mutations.
 *
 * Creating a workspace, opening a worktree, starting an agent, and delivering a
 * first instruction are four independent server operations. Herdr offers no
 * transaction across them, so this state machine is explicit about that: each
 * step records its own outcome, a successful step is never undone because a
 * later one failed, and a failed run can be retried from the step that broke
 * without repeating the work already done.
 *
 * The draft lives in memory for the life of the tab, which is what makes
 * `/runs/new` a real route: dismissing it and coming back resumes exactly where
 * the operator left off. It is never persisted — the objective is user content
 * bound for a shell.
